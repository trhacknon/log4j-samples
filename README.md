# log4j-samples
Samples of log4j library versions to help log4j scanners / detectors (including our own [log4j-detector](https://github.com/trhacknon/log4j-detector)) improve their accuracy for detecting CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-44228.

The samples include shaded jars, [uber jars](https://mergebase.com/blog/software-composition-analysis-sca-vs-java-uber-jars/), spring-boot executable jars, jars inside jars, exploded jars, etc.

# Directory Organization

- [./false-hits/](./false-hits/) - No sample in here is vulnerable to CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-44228.
- [./old-hits/](./old-hits/) - Every sample in here contains versions of Log4J (1.x and 2.x) that are too old to be vulnerable.
- [./true-hits/](./true-hits/) - Every sample in here **is vulnerable** to CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-44228.

# Why Are \*.zip Files Included In The Samples?

Java treats \*.zip exactly the same as \*.jar, and always has. You really don't want attackers to simply rename "webapp/WEB-INF/lib/log4j-core-2.9.jar" to "log4j-core-2.9.zip" to defeat your scanner! Don't believe me?  Try this:

```
$ wget https://github.com/trhacknon/log4j-samples/raw/master/false-hits/log4j-detector-2021.12.16.zip
$ java -jar log4j-detector-2021.12.16.zip

Usage: java -jar log4j-detector-2021.12.16.jar [--verbose] [paths to scan...]

Exit codes:  0 = No vulnerable Log4J versions found.
             1 = At least one legacy Log4J 1.x version found.
             2 = At least one vulnerable Log4J 2.x version found.
